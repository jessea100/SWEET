Project_Title: "SWEET" - "Support groups Wellness education Eating habits Exercise routines Testing blood sugar"

Research_Question: "What role do health indicators and population factors, play in determining the prevalence of diabetes?"

Content: "Diabetes is a common chronic disease in the United States, affecting millions of people each year and causing a significant financial burden on the economy. It impairs glucose regulation, resulting in a lower quality of life and life expectancy. Diabetes can lead to complications such as heart disease, vision loss, lower limb amputation, and kidney disease. Strategies such as weight loss, healthy eating, and medical treatment can help to mitigate its effects. As of 2018, 34.2 million Americans had diabetes, while 88 million had prediabetes. Ins summary, Diabetes very prevalent in the United States and the wider world, and its incidence varies according to age, education, income, location, and other social determinants."

Context: "The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual health-related telephone survey conducted by the CDC. Every year, over 400,000 Americans participate in the survey, which asks about health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of preventive services. It has been held annually since 1984. For this project, a csv of the dataset available on Kaggle in 2015 was used. This original dataset contains 441,455 responses and 330 features. These features are either questions directly posed to participants or calculated variables based on individual participant responses."

Abstract: "Diabetes and prediabetes constitute significant public health challenges globally, impacting millions of individuals and posing substantial economic burdens. This project will explore the prevalence, risk factors, and implications of these conditions using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a comprehensive survey conducted annually by the CDC. Analyzing this dataset will investigate the socioeconomic, and health factors associated with non - diabetic and prediabetes patients in the United States. Findings underscore the critical roles of age, education, income, and ghealth factors in shaping prevalence rates and highlight the importance of lifestyle interventions and healthcare strategies in mitigating these conditions' impact on individuals and society.
