# Visualization Methods

#### Ideas: 
- Counts and percentages of respondents with diabetes across different age groups (e.g., 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, etc.).
- Mean age and standard deviation within each diabetes status category to understand the age distribution of diabetic respondents.
- Median income and interquartile range (IQR) among respondents with different diabetes statuses.
- Cross-tabulations showing diabetes prevalence by age group, income bracket, education level, etc.
- Correlation coefficients between diabetes status and variables like smoking, physical activity, and fruit/vegetable consumption.
- Counts and percentages of respondents with diabetes across different age groups (e.g., 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, etc.).
- Mean age and standard deviation within each diabetes status category to understand the age distribution of diabetic respondents.
- Tabulate counts and percentages of diabetes prevalence by gender (male vs. female).
- Calculate mean age and standard deviation separately for males and females with diabetes.
- Create frequency tables showing the distribution of diabetes prevalence across income brackets (e.g., less than $25,000, $25,000-$50,000, etc.).
- Summarize diabetes prevalence by education level (e.g., high school graduate, college degree, etc.) and calculate median income within each education category.
- Cross-tabulate smoking status (smoker vs. non-smoker) with diabetes prevalence.
- Calculate percentages of smokers and non-smokers within the diabetic and non-diabetic groups.
- Summarize physical activity levels (active vs. inactive) by diabetes status.
- Calculate the mean number of days per week respondents engage in physical activity within each diabetes status group.
- Analyze fruit and vegetable consumption (daily vs. less than daily) and its association with diabetes prevalence.
- Tabulate counts and percentages of respondents with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and their overlap with diabetes.
- Calculate correlations between these conditions to understand their co-occurrence patterns.
- Summarize the percentage of respondents with and without healthcare coverage (including health insurance) by diabetes status.
- Calculate the proportion of respondents who reported cost-related access barriers to healthcare and their diabetes status.
- Frequency tables showing the proportion of respondents who have had regular doctor visits in the past year, by diabetes status.
- Summarize the prevalence of recent cholesterol checks and diabetes screening among different demographic groups.
