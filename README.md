### Abstract: 
Understanding the primary risk factors for diabetes is critical for a variety of reasons. Diabetes, particularly Type 2 diabetes, is a growing public health concern worldwide, affecting millions of people and putting a significant strain on healthcare systems. Identifying and understanding these risk factors enables healthcare providers, policymakers, and public health officials to develop targeted prevention strategies, implement early screening programs, and optimize treatment approaches to reduce diabetes incidence and impact in populations. Furthermore, understanding these factors can lead to more personalized diabetes prevention and management strategies, potentially improving health outcomes and quality of life for those affected.

The research question, "What are the primary risk factors associated with the development of diabetes in a given population?" seeks to identify the specific factors that contribute most significantly to the onset of diabetes within a defined group. This includes looking into demographic characteristics like age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, as well as lifestyle factors like diet, physical activity, and smoking habits. The study will also look at clinical parameters like body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, lipid levels, and family history of diabetes. The study's goal is to quantify the relative importance of each risk factor and their interactions using comprehensive datasets and advanced statistical methods, resulting in actionable insights for healthcare providers and policymakers.
